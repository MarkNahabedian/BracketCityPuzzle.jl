Each bracket is identified with a unique number so we can indicate which clue is being answered. I can add those answers I can figure out:\n\nset_answer(parsed, 6, \"best\")\nset_answer(parsed, 5, \"forward\")\nset_answer(parsed, 8, \"abba\")\nset_answer(parsed, 14, \"crack\")\nset_answer(parsed, 16, \"duty\")\nset_answer(parsed, 15, \"call\")\nset_answer(parsed, 13, \"ritz\")\nset_answer(parsed, 12, \"hotel\")\nset_answer(parsed, 11, \"five\")\n\nshow_puzzle(preduce(parsed))\n\nAbove, preduce is used so that fully solved bracket expressions are replaced with their answers.\n\nAt this point, I wasn't able too figure out any of the highlighted clues, but I was able to figure out several outer clues, so I answered those:\n\nset_answer(parsed, 1, \"may\")           # to whom it may concern\nset_answer(parsed, 2, \"once\")          # cONCErn\nset_answer(parsed, 3, \"bed\")           # bedtime stories\n\nshow_puzzle(preduce(parsed))\n\nOnce I had the context for the remaining clues, their answers were straightforward\n\nset_answer(parsed, 4, \"fast\")\nset_answer(parsed, 10, \"eight\")\nset_answer(parsed, 9, \"infinity\")\nset_answer(parsed, 7, \"catch\")\nshow_puzzle(preduce(parsed))\n\nThat is why I find this software helpful for solving Bracket City puzzles.","category":"section"},{"location":"#Index","page":"Home","title":"Index","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"#Definitions","page":"Home","title":"Definitions","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"#My-Score-Graph","page":"Home","title":"My Score Graph","text":"A graph comparing my solved puzzle scores with tose of the entire Bracket City community can be found\n\n<a href=\"graph_my_score.html\">\n    here\n</a>.","category":"section"},{"location":"#BracketCityPuzzle.Bracket","page":"Home","title":"BracketCityPuzzle.Bracket","text":"Bracket(clue, answer)\n\nRepresents a bracketed clue, and possibly its answer.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"type"},{"location":"#BracketCityPuzzle.all_brackets-Tuple{Vector{Union{Bracket, AbstractString}}}","page":"Home","title":"BracketCityPuzzle.all_brackets","text":"all_brackets(parsed::BCPuzzle)\n\nReturns a vector of all of the Brackets within parsed.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"method"},{"location":"#BracketCityPuzzle.findBracket","page":"Home","title":"BracketCityPuzzle.findBracket","text":"findBracket(test, ::BCPuzzle)::Vector{Bracket}\n\nReturns a vector of Bracket objects that match test, which can be a predicate or a substring to match.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"#BracketCityPuzzle.hasanswer-Tuple{Bracket}","page":"Home","title":"BracketCityPuzzle.hasanswer","text":"hasanswer(::Bracket)\n\nReturns true if the Bracket has an answer.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"method"},{"location":"#BracketCityPuzzle.issolved-Tuple{Union{Bracket, AbstractString}}","page":"Home","title":"BracketCityPuzzle.issolved","text":"issolved(::PuzzleElement)::Bool\n\nReturns true if the puzzle element is solved.\n\nA Bracket is solved only if it and all descendents are solved.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"method"},{"location":"#BracketCityPuzzle.parse_puzzle","page":"Home","title":"BracketCityPuzzle.parse_puzzle","text":"parse_puzzle(string_or_token_vector)\n\nParses the string representation of a Bracket City puzzle.
